# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied - Build Process Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly to components, despite being correctly defined in the configuration file. The issue stems from a problem during the build process where the Tailwind classes are not being included in the final CSS output.

## Bug Description
Tailwind classes are defined in `tailwind.config.js` and used within components but do not appear in the rendered HTML or the compiled CSS file.  This suggests a failure in the build pipeline to correctly process and include the Tailwind directives.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the build process (instructions will vary depending on your setup, e.g., `npm run build`)
3. Inspect the generated CSS and the rendered HTML. The Tailwind classes will be missing.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the correct build process and configuration of your Tailwind setup.  The provided `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a corrected implementation.
