The issue was resolved by ensuring that the correct build process was used and the Tailwind plugin was properly configured in the build pipeline. In my case, I was missing a plugin or a configuration step in my Webpack configuration.  The corrected configuration includes the necessary Tailwind plugin and ensures the correct order of operations in the build process.  Specifically, adding `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins to `postcss.config.js` within `webpack.config.js` correctly processed the Tailwind directives.
